            I love building exceptional teams and intuitive software. I'm a co-founder (currently inactive) of <a href="https://soom.la/" target="_blank">SOOMLA</a>, where I took the role of VP R&D and later on VP Marketing.  During four years, I built and grew the company's flagship analytics product to reach 50 million users and +7000 mobile apps. Prior to SOOMLA, I worked for various startups and enterprise companies in the Israeli tech scene.

            Though I'm hooked on technology, I always dig an outdoor hike to clear my mind and get some inspiration.  In the words of wilderness pioneer John Muir -
            <blockquote><p>“In every walk with nature one receives far more than he seeks.”</blockquote>
