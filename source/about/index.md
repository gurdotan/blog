I love building exceptional teams and intuitive software. I'm a co-founder (currently inactive) of [SOOMLA](https://soom.la/), where I took the role of VP R&D and later on VP Marketing.  During four years, I built and grew the company's flagship analytics product to reach 50 million users and +7000 mobile apps. Prior to SOOMLA, I worked for various startups and enterprises in the Israeli tech scene.

Though I'm a digital nomad, I always dig a nature hike to clear your mind and get some inspiration.  In the words of wilderness pioneer John Muir - 
<blockquote><p>“In every walk with nature one receives far more than he seeks.”</blockquote>
